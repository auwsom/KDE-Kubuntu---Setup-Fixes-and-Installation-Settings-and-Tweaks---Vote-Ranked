# Kubuntu and KDE - Setup, Settings and Tweaks

A collection of common improvements to Kubuntu / KDE
* Vote ranked by GitHub's "reactions" (likes, or thumbs) on each Issue
* List your single configuration item as a separate Issue and vote
* **To vote for an Issue, open it, click on the smiley and add a Thumbs Up**
* Serves as a repository of crowdsourced improvements for common issues

.

This should show the Issues sorted by most 'Thumbs Up' reactions:

..Eventually there will be a general Ubuntu list separate from Kubuntu / KDE, but the aim is to provide a user from Windows the easiest startup path to an open source version of what their used to, and I believe Kubuntu (despite being larger than others) is that. Mint is close, but there are many more 'power' GUI features, Krusader being a prime example.
